2-gather
========

A small experiment with conditional attendance lists. Used for my volleyball trainings.

Sorry, the spec is in Polish and I have no needs to translate it to English. I hope that two pics will be a good puzzle to figure out what the software does.

Also, this code is not production-quality. I was plating around with Mojolicious, KiokuDB, Validator::Custom and Moose, and this code is a temporarily satisfying result.
